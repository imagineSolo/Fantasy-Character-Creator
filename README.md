# Fantasy-Character-Creator
A character creator for an RPG game.

This is the first project I'm working on all by myself.
The idea is to practice the DOM manipulation. I'm a huge RPG fan so I thought I'd make a classic fantasy character creator. I have a lot of ideas so I'll try to update it in my free time between work and doing tutorials.

My goal is to catch the old school / retro feeling of the 80's roleplaying games.

Just a basic HTML & CSS structure (still WIP), JS is evolving so I think I should make additional .js files soon for making the project cleaner (--> done).

The project is designed for desktop users, however I plan on using RWD.

Plans:


* A character portrait selection based on choices made; --> done

* An attribute selector (numbers) modified by race and class choices; --> done

* Equipment selection (drag & drop);

*...
